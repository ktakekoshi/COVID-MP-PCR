# X-Y Liquid Handling Robotic Transfer / Dispensing System README

Proposed implementation:

- Copper pipette moves into open flame or hot silicone oil for rapid incineration of specimen residues; reduces need for tip changing mechanism.
- Plunger-type aspiration mechanism.
- May be preferable to place the well-array on a movable bed, and have dispenser on single axis (use a 3D printer bed).

Can be adapted from another open source project?
