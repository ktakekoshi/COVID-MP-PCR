# Fluorescent Reader README

The project envisions a real-time PCR fluorescent reader system.

Single channel or dual channel?  Single should suffice for now.

    - "The fluorescence of NIST-traceable fluorescein could be measured with an ∼10 nM limit of detection with the low-cost detector. Such a detection limit is sufficient for common fluorescence assays as intended, albeit greater than the ∼10 pM limit of commercial systems that use PMTs."
