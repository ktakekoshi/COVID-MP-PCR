# Thermoform Mold README

Provisional design guidance:
 
 - Well sizing and spacing to match standard 96-well microtiter well format, for compatibility with stock automated loaders when available.
 - Can substitute 3 x 3 grid of 9 standard 96-well microtiter dishes (on a frame) if thermoform mold is not used.
 - If standard 96-well microtiter dishes are overlaid, design incoroprates additional well spaces to provide space for plate flanges - hopefully enough additional space is provided.
 
 Provisional specs:
 
 - F-bottom well configuration.
 - 6.96 mm well diameter at opening; 6.39 mm well diameter at base.
 - 10.9 mm well depth.
 - 9 mm well spacing (center to center).
 - 33 wells rows x 42 columns = 1386 wells.
 - Hopefully provides enough space to overlay 9 (3 x 3) microtiter plates if preferred.
